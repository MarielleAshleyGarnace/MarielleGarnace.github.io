<h1>Hello you beautiful people!</h1>
<body>
<br>The name is: Marielle Ashley</br>
<br>You can call me: Marielle/Ashley lol</br> 
<br>I currently study: Bachelor of arts in Multimedia Arts</br>   
<br>Did I choose this course? Sure indeed</br> 
<br>Why yes?</br> 
<br>Making art has always been my passion since my childhood self and that has never changed. Cliche as it sounds, it pretty much one of the reasons why I am still striving to this day.</br>
<br>I.T experience:</br> 
<br>Programming from PROGCON</br> 
<br>Hobbies/ Interest /Libangan:</br> 
Play games, make Personal art (Drawing, Painting), watch Youtube videos and listening to music. 
<br>Goals in life:</br> 
Be better and improve my art skills and help out other people through those skills. 
<br>What do you expect to learn from this course?: 
<br>What I expect is we still would do some programming but hopefully I get the hang of it since due to studying PROGCON last sem.</br> 
<br>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major?:</br> 
Since art and programming is pretty much connected now like as mentioned this is going to tackle web programming and in game concepts/design, It was mentioned that web designing does have some programming and possibly gaming stuff, hopefully that helps me when I create my works.</br>
